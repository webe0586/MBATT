Hello Autumn:

This is your mid-season attendance update.

Minutes Missed: 180
Minutes to Make up: 180
Unexcused Absences: 5

Assuming you grade started at an A (100%), with you attendance factored in, you grade would be a(n) F(30%).

You have unexcused absences, for each of those your grade is docked 10%.  Please check MBATT and submit the appropriate absence form.
You have minutes to make up, if you are concerned about making up the time, please come talk to me and we can discuss a plan for you to make up the time.

The table below describes how your minutes to make up affect your grade, for your reference.

90 minutes remaining or less = up to one letter grade reduction;  
91­180 minutes = up to two letter grade reduction;  
181-270 minutes = up to three letter grade reduction;  
over 270 minutes remaining = up to four letter grade reduction. 


Thanks,
Julie
